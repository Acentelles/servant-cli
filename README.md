# servant-cli

Parse command line arguments into a servant client, from a servant API, using
*optparse-applicative* for parsing, displaying help, and auto-completion.

Hooks into the annotation system used by *servant-docs* to provide descriptions
for parameters and captures.

See `example/greet.hs` for a sample program.
